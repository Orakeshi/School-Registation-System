# School-Registation-System
A school registration system that uses a barcode reader for input. 
The system uses the barcode reader to identify the students unique ID where they will be able to sign in and select multiple options. 
The options range from signing in as late to signing out and on site, when on and off the school premises.

you will need to create a Students.txt file and allocate a Unique barcode ID, a Students name, On site and Time

------- EXAMPLE -----
016519;James Duncan;On Site;No;Time
016531;Donald Trump;On Site;No;Time
016543;bob Ross;On Site;No;Time

This is the layout for ever student -- the word "Time" is replaced by the actual time the student is late by .. furthermore On Site will be replaced if not on sit.
